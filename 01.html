    <h3>Before Adopting <a href ="https://cotswoldsdogsandcatshome.org.uk/dogs-for-adoption/"
    title ="Adopt dog" target="blank">Dogs</a></h3>
    <p>We are committed to finding the perfect home for our animals
    and the perfect animal for you. Below is a little more information
    about how our adoption process works.
    <ul>
    <li>Take the time to read about the animals we have available for
    adoption.</li> <li>The next step would be to register your interest by
    completing a Perfect Match form.</li> <li>If we have a suitable match for you,
    one of our rehoming team will be in touch to chat through a potential new family
    member. Please note, due to the volume of applications, we cannot respond to
    every application.</li> <li>We would then complete a Home Visit.</li> <li>The next
    stage is a bit like a first date – where you’ll meet your potential match,
    learn a little more about them and see if it’s love at first sight.</li> <li>If everything
    goes well, you might like a second date.</li> <li>You'll come in for a
    final chat, we'll go through the paperwork and process the adoption fee, and then
    you can take your new family member home!</li>
    </ul>
    If you cannot see your perfect match at this time, you can still register your interest
    by completing a general enquiry Perfect Match Form.</p>
